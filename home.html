        <img src="dosa.png" alt="" class="dosa" > &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Dosa</b>, mixture of rice and black or green gram that has been soaked in water is ground 
        finely to form a batter. Some add a bit of soaked fenugreek seeds. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency. 
        The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava or griddle greased with oil or ghee. It is spread out with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. 
        It is usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina<br><br>

        <img src="freid.png" alt="" class="freid" > &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Chicken freid rice</b>, is a dish that is meant to repurpose leftover rice from a day or two before. 
        The first time I tried cooking fried rice on my own, I made the mistake of using freshly cooked rice.nothing like what my mother cooked. I don’t even remember if I ate much of that batch of fried rice, 
        but I certainly learned a big lesson!
        Because it was still so moist and soft, resulting dish was far too gummy nothing like what my mother cooked. <br><br>

        <img src="tandoori.png" alt="" class="tandoori" > &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Tandoori chicken</b>, is a tender, flavor-bombed chicken dish that’s a staple in Indian cuisine. 
        Though traditionally the chicken is grilled in a clay tandoor grill (hence the name), it’s possible to make it at home in your oven. The real stand-out in this timeless recipe is the use of a masala-yogurt marinade that coats the chicken throughout 
        the cooking process, making it exceedingly juicy and extra flavorful. You can marinate the chicken in the morning, then roast it for just 30 minutes when you’re ready for dinner. <br><br>

        <img src="muttonrice.png" alt="" class="muttonrice" > &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Mutton rice</b>, Because this curry is slow cooker, the cut of meat you use doesn't matter as much. But I really love using shoulder to make lamb curry. 
        It has some fat, tender meat and enough bones to give this curry what it needs. And yes, don't get rid of the bones. They stew and add to the curry so totally worth keeping some.<br><br>
